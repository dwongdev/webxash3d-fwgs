## 🎯 Looking for AMX Mod X Support?

If you want **AMX Mod X and Metamod pre-installed and ready to use**, check out the [hl-web-server-metpamx](https://github.com/yohimik/webxash3d-fwgs/tree/main/docker/hl-web-server-metpamx) variant. It includes:
- Pre-configured Metamod-P
- AMX Mod X with all base modules
- Ready for custom plugins out of the box

This base version is compatible with AMX Mod X but requires manual installation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🎮 Game Content (Required)

To run the game, you must provide original **Half-Life game files** from Steam. These must be packaged in a
`valve.zip` file and mounted into the Docker container.

### 📦 `valve.zip` Structure

```plaintext
valve.zip
├── valve/
```

The `valve.zip` file must contain the following two directories from your Steam installation:

### ✅ Prerequisites

* Docker installed
* A public IP address (if hosting outside LAN)
* An open UDP port (e.g. 27018)

You must mount the file to the container path `/xashds/public/valve.zip`:

```shell
docker run -d \
  -p 27016:27016 \
  -p <your-port>:<your-port> \
  -p <your-port>:<your-port>/udp \
  -e IP=<your-public-ip> \
  -e PORT=<your-port> \
  -v $(pwd)/valve.zip:/xashds/public/valve.zip \
  yohimik/hl-web-server:latest \
  +map crossfire +maxplayers 14
```

```yaml
services:
  xash3d:
    image: yohimik/hl-web-server:latest
    command: [ "+map crossfire", "+maxplayers 14" ]
    restart: always
    platform: linux/386
    environment:
      PORT: <your-port>
      IP: <your-public-ip>
    volumes:
      - "./valve.zip:/xashds/public/valve.zip"
    ports:
      - "27016:27016"
      - "<your-port>:<your-port>"
      - "<your-port>:<your-port>/udp"

```

Replace the placeholders:

* `<your-public-ip>` — your server's external IP
* `<your-port>` — open UDP port (e.g. 27018)

Then open `http://<your-server-ip>:27016` in your browser!

| `IP`                   | Public IP address for WebRTC connection                | `123.45.67.89`  |
| `PORT`                 | UDP port for HL server (must be open)                  | `27018`         |
| `DISABLE_X_POWERED_BY` | Set to `true` to remove the `X-Powered-By` HTTP header | `true`          |

## 🛠️ Customization

* Client UI/UX: Modify files in src/client

To include custom plugins:

* Mount a volume to `/xashds` inside the container
* Or copy plugin files into the Docker build context
